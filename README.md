Code for the course CTA395 at UofT. In this project we analyzed the 21cm emission data, to study large scale structure of the universe. This is a part of large pipeline developed by graduate students and postdocs in Ue-Li Pen's group. Specifically it concerns about developing virtual 21cm emission 3D maps, which afterwards can be compared with the data from the GBT(Green Bank Telescope).
